This exploratory data analysis assesses how the data columns from the coupons.csv can be used to estimate the acceptance rate. The acceptance rates are normalised for comparison.

Key findings include:
1) Coupons are highly likely to be accepted for carry outs/take aways and cheap restaurants (74% and 71% respectively).
2) Coupons are more likely to be accepted (63%) when drivers are not heading home (51%) or to work (50%).
3) Drivers with passenger friends are more likely to accept coupons (68%).
4) Coupons have a higher acceptance rate on sunny days (60%).
5) Longer expiry (1d) coupons have a higher acceptance rate than shorter expiry (2h) coupons (63% vs 50% respectively).
6) Singles are more likely to accept coupons(61%).
7) 'Healthcare Practitioners & Technical' and 'Production Occupations' occupations have the highest coupon acceptance rates (72% and 70% respectively).
8) No material relationship between income and coupon acceptance.

Further analysis for Bar coupons and Coffee House coupons are captured in the Jupyter Notebook.
